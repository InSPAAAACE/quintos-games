Each of the following code segments contain one or more errors. Explain the error(s), then fix the code.

```java
if (num != 4) {
	System.out.println("The number is not 4.");
}
//no closing brackets, printing spelled wrong, and quotes are not of the same pair.
```

```java
System.out.println("Enter a number:");
int num = sc.nextInt();

if (num == 2)
{
  System.out.println("The number is 2.");
}
else if (num == 3)
{
  System.out.println("The number is 3.");
}
else
{
	System.out.println("The number is not 2 or 3.");
}

//no ; , == change to =, change = to == in booleans and put brackets.
```

```java
int num = random(1, 40);

 if (num >= 20)
{
	Systm.out.println("The number is greater then or equal to 20.");
}
else if (num > 10)
{
  System.out.println("The number is between 10 (not included) and 20.");
}
```

What is the difference between an if statement and a while loop?
if is the boolean method that works if true (one time) and while is a loop

What happens to variables created in a scope after the end of the scope is reached?
if a variable is created inside a scope it can't be used outsides its scope, so the variable would no longer exist

Each of the following code segments contain one or more errors. Explain the error(s), then fix the code.

```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int num = 0;

while (num <= 7)
{
  System.out.println("Enter a number greater than 7:");
  num = sc.nextInt();
}

System.out.println("Thank you!");
```

```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
String guess = "";
String myFavoriteFood = "pizza";

while (guess.equals(myFavoriteFood))
{
  System.out.println("Guess my favorite food:");
  guess = sc.nextLine();
}

System.out.println("You guessed it!");
```
