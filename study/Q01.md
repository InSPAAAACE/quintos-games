What happens to variables created in a scope after the end of the scope is reached?
if a variable is created inside a scope it can't be used outsides its scope, so the variable would no longer exist

Each of the following code segments contain one or more errors. Explain the error(s), then fix the code.

```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int num = 0;

while (num <= 7)
{
  System.out.println("Enter a number greater than 7:");
  num = sc.nextInt();
}

System.out.println("Thank you!");
```

```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
String guess = "";
String myFavoriteFood = "pizza";

while (guess.equals(myFavoriteFood))
{
  System.out.println("Guess my favorite food:");
  guess = sc.nextLine();
}

System.out.println("You guessed it!");
```
